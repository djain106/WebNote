# WebNote
A Google Chrome extension that allows users to take notes like a sticky note based on the web domain that they are on. For example, www.google.com and www.youtube.com will have their own set of notes. These notes will be saved based upon user login and can be accessed on any computer that has Google Chrome Sync enabled on their browser. The application is still a work in progress and will be uploaded to the Chrome Web Store for download. Users can manually install the extension with the following steps.

1. Enable Developer Mode in chrome://extensions
2. ```git clone https://github.com/djain106/WebNote.git ```
3. Under chrome://extensions, click Load Unpacked and navigate to the WebNote folder.
